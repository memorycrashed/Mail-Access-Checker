# Mail-Access-Checker

This is a simple mail access checker that also searches through the body of every email to find keywords.

This is made for educational purposes and because I was bored. I do not encourage any illegal activity.

I know the code is bad, but it works.

hoster.dat was grabbed from https://github.com/SUP3RIA/Atlantr but I made a few modifications to it.

# How to run:
```
python3 mailaccess.py
```

You need to put the combolist in the same directory.
